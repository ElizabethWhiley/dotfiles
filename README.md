# dotfiles
A way to help me set up and maintain my Mac

Run ./install.sh

Open installed apps and save them in dock eg.
    - chrome
    - notion
    - vscode
    - docker
    - slack 

TODO: 
- .vimrc - colors + symlink it
- could move all the export path lines from .zshrc to .profile (this moves across shells)
